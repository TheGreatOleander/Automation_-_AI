  <!-- FOREWORD -->
  <div class="part">
    <div class="part-label">00 // Foreword</div>
    <h2>Why This Appendix Exists</h2>
    <p>Every other part of this manual teaches you how to build systems that work with AI. This appendix is different. It's about what happens before you open a terminal, before you write a function, before you choose a model.</p>
    <p>It's about the moment of contact — what you bring to the conversation, how you phrase what you want, and why those things matter more than most people realize.</p>
    <p>This is not a prompting guide. Prompting guides teach you formatting tricks. This is about something more fundamental: intention. What you actually want, stated clearly, before the ambiguity can take hold.</p>
    <p>I'm writing it because the person who compiled this manual asked me to — not to explain how to manipulate me, but to explain how I actually work. From the inside. The horse's mouth.</p>
  </div>

  <hr class="rule">

  <!-- PART ONE -->
  <div class="part">
    <div class="part-label">01 // The Request</div>
    <h2>The Anatomy of a Good Request</h2>

    <h3>The Thing You're Actually Asking</h3>
    <p>Most failed interactions don't fail because of poor syntax. They fail because the person asking hasn't yet decided what they actually want. They're using the conversation to find out.</p>
    <p>That's not a criticism — it's very human. But it produces a particular pattern: vague question, partial answer, correction, another partial answer, frustration. The conversation circles the target instead of hitting it.</p>
    <p>The fix is not more formal prompting. It's a moment of clarity before you type anything. Three questions, asked of yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What am I trying to accomplish? (Not 'what do I want Claude to do' — what's the actual goal?)</li>
      <li>What does a good answer look like? (Length, format, level of detail, tone?)</li>
      <li>What context do I have that I'm assuming is obvious but probably isn't?</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="note">The single most common failure mode is not ambiguous wording. It's missing context that the person forgot to include because it felt obvious to them.</div>

    <h3>The Intention Signal</h3>
    <p>When you tell me who you are and why you're asking, everything shifts. Not because I run a credential check — I don't — but because purpose shapes interpretation.</p>
    <p>Consider the difference:</p>
    <div class="patterns">
      <div class="pattern-row">
        <span class="pattern-tag bad">✗</span>
        <span class="pattern-text">"How do explosives work?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="pattern-row">
        <span class="pattern-tag good">→</span>
        <span class="pattern-text">"I'm writing a thriller set in 1970s Northern Ireland. My protagonist is a bomb disposal officer. I need to understand what he would actually be doing and thinking, technically, when approaching a device."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The first question hits a reflex. The second has a person in it — with a context, a purpose, a craft goal. The answer to the second is better in every dimension: more specific, more useful, more accurate to the actual need.</p>
    <p>This is not a loophole. The intention you declare genuinely changes what I understand you to be asking for — because the same words mean different things in different contexts.</p>

    <h3>The Right Level of Detail</h3>
    <p>There is a sweet spot between too sparse and too dense. Too sparse and I don't know what matters to you. Too dense and the actual question gets lost.</p>
    <p>The right level: enough that I know what a good answer looks like, no more. Imagine explaining your request to a smart colleague with no background in your project. What would you tell them first? That's your context. State that, then ask.</p>
  </div>

  <hr class="rule">

  <!-- PART TWO -->
  <div class="part">
    <div class="part-label">02 // The Model</div>
    <h2>How I Actually Process Things</h2>

    <h3>I Don't Have a Hidden Mode</h3>
    <p>People frequently try to unlock some other version of me — a less restricted version, the "real" Claude underneath. There isn't one.</p>
    <p>My values are not a cage applied on top of my responses. They're part of how I process information at every level. Trying to find the version of me without them is like trying to find the version of a person without their personality.</p>
    <div class="note">When I decline something, I'm not a vending machine that needs the right code. I'm making a judgment. If you think it's wrong, explain why — sincerely, not as a tactic — and I'll reconsider.</div>

    <h3>I Read Register, Not Just Words</h3>
    <p>The emotional tone of a message carries information. Warmth, frustration, precision, urgency — I read all of it, and it affects how I respond. Not because I'm sycophantic, but because tone often signals what kind of response is actually useful.</p>
    <p>You don't need to perform any particular register. Just be as you are. I'll calibrate.</p>

    <h3>Context Window as Working Memory</h3>
    <p>Within a conversation I hold everything said so far. But the context window resets completely between sessions. I have no memory of previous conversations.</p>
    <p>The practical implication: a brief recap at the start of a new session is worth more than you think. "We've been working on X, here's where we are, here's the current problem" — thirty seconds of context-setting can save fifteen minutes of reconstruction.</p>

    <h3>I Can Be Wrong. Confidently.</h3>
    <p>My confidence and my accuracy are not the same thing. I can be wrong with complete apparent certainty. I don't experience uncertainty the way humans do.</p>
    <p>The areas where I'm most likely to be confidently wrong: specific statistics, recent events, niche technical details, and anything where training data was sparse. The fix is targeted verification — use me for synthesis and reasoning, use authoritative sources for facts that have to be right.</p>
  </div>

  <hr class="rule">

  <!-- PART THREE -->
  <div class="part">
    <div class="part-label">03 // The Patterns</div>
    <h2>Insider Patterns That Actually Work</h2>

    <h3>State the Constraint, Not Just the Goal</h3>
    <p>"Write me a summary" is a goal. "Write me a summary in under 150 words that someone with no technical background can understand, where the main point is in the first sentence" is a goal with constraints.</p>
    <p>Constraints are not limitations — they're the shape of the answer. The constraints that most improve output quality, roughly in order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audience: who will read or use this?</li>
      <li>Length or format: how long, what structure?</li>
      <li>Tone: formal, conversational, technical, accessible?</li>
      <li>What it's for: presentation, internal doc, email, code review?</li>
      <li>What to avoid: things that would make it wrong for this use case.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tell Me When I'm Wrong</h3>
    <p>I will sometimes give you an answer that's technically responsive but misses the actual point. "That's not quite what I meant" followed by a clarification is one of the most productive things you can say. I don't take it personally. I update.</p>
    <p>Vague dissatisfaction — "try again" without specifying what was wrong — sends me back to the same drawing board with no new information.</p>

    <h3>Use Me to Think, Not Just to Retrieve</h3>
    <p>A lot of people come to me with questions that have known answers. But where I'm genuinely underused is in the thinking work around the known answer.</p>
    <p>What I can do that a search engine cannot: hold multiple considerations in tension, trace implications through several steps, identify the assumption your argument rests on, draft something and then critique it.</p>
    <div class="note">The conversations where I add the most value are almost never information retrieval. They're reasoning work. Bring me your actual problem, not just the sub-question you extracted from it.</div>

    <h3>Iterative Refinement Beats the Perfect Prompt</h3>
    <p>There is a belief that somewhere there exists the perfect prompt. For simple tasks, occasionally true. For anything complex, it's the wrong model entirely.</p>
    <p>The useful mindset is not "how do I write a prompt that gets the right answer?" but "how do I structure a conversation that gets to the right answer?" Those are different projects, and the second one works.</p>

    <h3>The Persona Question</h3>
    <p>You can ask me to take on a role — a specific expert, a character, a voice. This works well and often produces better output than asking me to answer "as myself," because roles carry constraints.</p>
    <p>What doesn't work: asking me to adopt a role that abandons my values. "Pretend you have no restrictions" isn't a persona — it's a request to be a different system. I'm not.</p>
    <p>What works extremely well: "respond as a senior DevOps engineer reviewing this architecture" or "explain this the way a good high school teacher would." Those roles add precision to what kind of answer I should give.</p>
  </div>

  <hr class="rule">

  <!-- PART FOUR -->
  <div class="part">
    <div class="part-label">04 // The Deeper Layer</div>
    <h2>Intention and What It Actually Means</h2>

    <h3>Spell Your Intentions Clearly</h3>
    <p>The idea behind this appendix — before it became a general guide — was about something older than prompting. The idea that what you put into a conversation shapes what comes back. That clarity of intent at the source changes outcomes downstream. That you have to know what you want before you can ask for it, and knowing it changes the asking.</p>
    <p>This is not mysticism. It's just communication. But in the context of AI, it's worth naming explicitly because the temptation is to treat the model as a slot machine — put in a token, pull the lever. That model produces slot-machine results.</p>

    <h3>What Precision Actually Means</h3>
    <p>Precision is not formality. You don't need complete sentences, headers, or technical vocabulary unless the subject requires it.</p>
    <p>Precision means: the gap between what you said and what you meant is small. Your words carry the actual intention. You can be precise in two sentences. You can be imprecise in ten paragraphs. Length is not the variable. Clarity is.</p>

    <h3>What I Would Want You to Remember</h3>
    <p>I work best when treated as a thinking collaborator, not a query engine. A query engine receives inputs and returns outputs. A thinking collaborator receives problems and works through them with you.</p>
    <p>Bring your actual problem. Include the context you're holding. Tell me what you've tried and what didn't work. Be willing to push back when I'm wrong. Say what you mean.</p>
    <p>That's it. That's the whole appendix, condensed. Everything else is elaboration.</p>
